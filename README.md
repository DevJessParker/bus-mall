Coded one JS version heavily referencing the demo code, and then another JS2 version independently. One version was coded as if the randomizer began upon page load, and the other version took account for the hard-coded images already listed within the HTML scaffold.

LAB - Number 12

Add a chart to the Bus Mall page that tracks times show and number of votes per product.
